What you need:
- Spicetify-Installer.bat
- command.ps1

To start the installer please open the "Spicetify-Installer.bat".

If there is a popup window from windows security when you open the "Spicetify-Installer.bat" then click on "More info" and then on "Run anyway".
This message comes because windows thinks that it is a virus or something bad because there is no certificate.

Hope you enjoy the installer :D
